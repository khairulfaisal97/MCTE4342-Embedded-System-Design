System Limitation
1. LED indicator for winner - show limited player win
2. Controller wired - to much wiring, and can be played short distance.
3. No sensor to count the ball - safety and fair
4. No sound indicator for winner - not fun
5. The ball are showing - make the game easier

Improvements
1. Change to LCD Display that can show how many time player win
2. Make wireless/bluetooth controller using HC-05 bluetooth model, also can be control using phone, more than 2 players
3. Put sensor to make sure right number of ball goes down as player choose, can use ultrasonic sensor or colour sensor
4. Put speaker/buzer to play the music for the winner
5. Make the ball hidden or make machine to release random number ball at start of the game
